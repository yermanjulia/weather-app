# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a specified location. Users can type the name of a city, and the app will display the current weather information for that city.

## The app provides the following details:

- The location (city name)
- The current temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- The weather conditions (like "Clear" or "Cloudy")
- The "feels like" temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- The humidity percentage
- The wind speed (in miles per hour)
- The weather app is built using React and Axios. It uses modern React features like hooks (for state management) and the functional component structure. Axios is used to handle HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Usage
